This directory contains library files used by uDraw(Graph), most
notably its Tcl/Tk user interface. uDraw(Graph) is configured to
look for the Tcl/Tk startup files in this directory.  This way
uDraw(Graph) doesn't need an installed Tcl/Tk in order to run.

Aside from the Tcl/Tk startup files there are many library files in
this directory which uDraw(Graph) needs. So don't modify the
content or location of this directory.

For directories containing third-party software please see the file
LICENSE.txt for licensing information.
