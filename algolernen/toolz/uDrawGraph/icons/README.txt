This directory contains example icons for use with the interactive
graph visualization system uDraw(Graph). The icons have several
formats which can be read by uDraw(Graph).

uDraw(Graph) is configured to look for icons in this directory,
so you shouldn't modify the existing files or the location of this
directory. Otherwise the example graphs cannot be visualized. But you
certainly may add icons.

The original contents of this directory as it comes with the
uDraw(Graph) distribution is copyrighted by Universitaet Bremen.
